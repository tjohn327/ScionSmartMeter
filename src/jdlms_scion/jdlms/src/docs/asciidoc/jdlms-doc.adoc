== Intro

jDLMS is a Java implementation of the DLMS/COSEM protocol. It can be
used to develop individual DLMS/COSEM client/master and server/slave
applications.

The jDLMS library supports communication over HDLC/serial, HDLC/TCP
and Wrapper/TCP.

== Using jDLMS

See the jDLMS link:https://www.openmuc.org/projects/jdlms/javadoc/[Javadoc] for
documentation of the API. You may want to take a look at the source code of the
ConsoleClient or the ConsoleServer which is part of the distribution.

=== Client

The following is a brief sample client that connects to a server and
reads (using the GET service) the list of COSEM objects available in the
logical device.

=== Server

The jDLMS server libray implements the DLMS/COSEM standard as folowing:

* interface classes (IC) can be defined by annotating the Java class with the
  CosemClass annotation, in addition the Java class must inherit the
  CosemInterfaceObject/CosemSnInterfaceObject class.
* COSEM methods and attributes are defined by annotating Java methods and attibutes
  with CosemMethod and CosemAttribute.
* instances of the a COSEM IC can then be added to a logical.
* logical devices can be registered on a server.

==== Annotation Processer

The jDLMS server comes with an annotaion processor. This annotation
processor makes it easier/safer to
develop a jDLMS server in an IDE like Eclipse or Intellij IDEA.

=== Command Line Application

A command line application is part of the library that can be used to
connect, read, write and scan DLMS devices. You can execute it using
the _jdlms-console-client_ script found in the folder _run-scripts_.
Executing the script without any parameters will print help
information to the screen.

Instead of running the application from the terminal you can create
Eclipse project files as explained in our
link:https://www.openmuc.org/faq/gradle_getting_started/[FAQs] and run
it from within Eclipse.

== DLMS/COSEM Concepts

DLMS/COSEM is an application layer protocol specifically designed for
communication with smart meters. The DLMS/COSEM standard is adopted by
the IEC TC13 WG 14 into the IEC 62056 standard series.

DLMS/COSEM supports multiple lower layer protocols. Communication over
TCP, UDP, RS-232, RS-485 and multiple power line protocols such as G3
is supported. Many meters offer an optical interface at the front of
the meter. One can communicate over this interface using optical
probes that convert the signal to RS-232 and back again.

In DLMS/COSEM the meter is called the _server_ (when used over IP) or
_slave_ (when accessed over HDLC/serial). The entity accessing the
meter is called the client or master respectively. In this manual we
will always use the terms client and server.

In most cases DLMS/COSEM communication uses either _HDLC_ or a special
_Wrapper Layer_ to add addressing information to the DLMS application
layer PDUs.

=== Physical and Logical Devices

In DLMS/COSEM, a physical smart meter device can host several so
called logical devices. Each logical device has an address in the
range [0, 16383]. As an example, a meter could consist of one
logical device for electricity metering at address 18 and another one
for a connected gas meter at address 67. No matter what type of smart
meter it is, a DLMS/COSEM device must contain a special logical device
called the _management logical device_ at address 1. The content of
this device may vary, but it must at least have a list of all
logical devices inside the physical smart meter. You are always
connecting to a single logical device with DLMS/COSEM.

:img-file: physical-device.png
image::{img-file}[title="COSEM physical device",width={width80}, link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]

=== Server Address

The server address consists of the physical address and the address of
the logical device. Over TCP/IP the physical address is equal to the
IP address and port. Over serial the physical address (also referred
to as the lower HDLC address) ranges from 0 to 16383. It can
either be left empty (over RS-232) or not (RS-485).

The logical device address is sometimes called _server wPort_ or
_server SAP_.

=== Client ID

The client ID (also called _client SAP_ or _client wPort_) defines the
access level with which the client connects to the logical device.
The client ID 16 is a special client ID, which refers to the _public
client_ for which no authentication or encryption is required.

=== Addressing Attributes and Methods

DLMS/COSEM groups the data of a logical device into objects. These objects are
always instances of _interface classes_ (IC) that are defined in IEC
62056-6-2.

Each COSEM object can contain several attributes and
methods. These are identified using attribute ID and method ID
respectively.

Attributes and methods can be addressed in two ways: using _logical
name referencing_ and _short name referencing_. The referencing method
needs is negotiated during connection build up. Logical name
referencing is recommend and is more commonly used.

==== Logical Name Referencing

A logical name is actually an OBIS code. It sometimes also called
_instance ID_. It is a 6 byte number that uniquely identifies an
object in a logical device. For example, the clock of a smart meter is
always reachable under the address _[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 255]_.

The meaning of an OBIS code is defined in IEC 62056-6-1. A list of all
possible logical names is published by the DLMS UA in an MS
link:http://www.dlms.com/documentation/listofstandardobiscodesandmaintenanceproces/index.html[Excel
sheet].  OBIS codes are in the format of _A-B:C.D.E*F_ where each
letter is one byte. Only bytes C and D are mandatory. The six bytes
have the following meaning:


[width="100%", cols="1,6", frame="none"]
|=======
| *+A+* | Medium: Defines the medium (e.g. electricity, gas) of the object. An object related to no medium (e.g. clock) is handled as abstract data.
| *+B+* | Channel: The channel number allows to differentiate between different inputs (e.g. when a data concentrator is connected to several meters).
| *+C+* | Defines the abstract of physical data items, related to the information source (e.g. reactive import energy).
| *+D+* | Defines types, or the result of the processing of physical quantities identified with the value groups *+A+* and *+C+*, according to various specific algorithms (e.g. time integral).
| *+E+* | The value group E defines further processing or classification of quantities identified by value groups *+A+* to *+D+* (e.g. tariff number).
| *+F+* | Defines the storage of the data, identified by *+A+* to *+E+* (e.g. different billing periods). May be set to +0xFF+ (+255+) where this is irrelevant.
|=======

Both attribute and method addresses consist of:

- Class ID
- Logical Name (i.e. Obis code or instance ID)
- Attribute ID / Method ID

The class ID of an object can be found in the
link:http://www.dlms.com/documentation/listofstandardobiscodesandmaintenanceproces/index.html[Excel
sheet] mentioned earlier, while the exact attribute ID depends on the
class ID and can be extracted the best way by consulting the document
IEC 62056-6-2 or the Blue Book from the DLMS UA. Usually the first
attribute (attribute ID 1) of an COSEM interface class (IC) is the
logical name of the object. Further attributes refer to actual data
(see section 4.5 of IEC 62056-6-2).

|===================================================



==== Short Name Referencing

The second way to address an attribute or method is by means of the so called _short
address_. Short addresses are used for small devices and should only be
used if the connected smart meter cannot communicate using logical
names.

When short name referencing is used the meter still holds a unique
logical name (i.e. Obis code) for each of its objects. In addition
each object has 2 byte short name that maps to the logical name. Thus
a client can address each attribute or method using 2 bytes only.

The address space of short addresses is not standardized like the logical
names, meaning that the same address can lead to different objects on
different devices.

jDLMS maps the Short Names to Logical Names.



=== DLMS Services

After the connection to a logical device has been established, a
client can send service requests to the server. In order to access an
attribute, you may invoke the GET or SET service on one or more
attributes in a single request. Similarly the ACTION service may be invoked on methods.

==== Selective Access

The GET and SET services allow the client to access just a part of a specific attribute.
The part is defined by some specific selective access parameters.
These selective access parameters are defined as part of the attribute specification.

=== Security

The DLMS/COSEM standard differentiates between two security
mechanisms: 1) the _authentication mechanism_ (i.e. security level)
and 2) the _encryption mechanism_ (i.e. security suite). The two
mechanisms often use the same keys but they can be chosen independently
of each other and can be used in any combination.

==== Authentication Mechanism

The authentication mechanism is the mechanism by which client and
server authenticate each other during connection build up. The
following authentication mechanisms (also called security levels)
exist:

Lowest Level Security (0):: No authentication is used.

Low Level Security (1, LLS):: Only the client is authenticated using a
plain text password.

High Level Security (>1, HLS):: In this case both client and server
are authenticated. First both client and server exchange _challenge
strings_ (e.g. a random strings). Then both use cryptographic
algorithms on these _challenge strings_ and send the result back. The
cryptographic algorith used for authentication depends on the HLS
level:

    HLS 2;; A manufacturer specific algorithm is used that is not
    standardized.

    HLS 3;; MD5 is used.

    HLS 4;; SHA-1 is used

    HLS 5;; Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) is used. The
    algorithm takes both the global encryption key (16 bytes) as well
    as the authentication key (16 bytes) as inputs.

    HLS 6;; using SHA-256

    HLS 7;; using ECDSA

The jDLMS library supports lowest level, low level as well as HLS 5
authentication at the moment.

==== Encryption Mechanism

The encryption mechanism is used to encrypt messages and/or add
authentication tags to individual messages. Until recently only one
encryption mechanism (also called security suite) existed. It
has the the ID 0. By now new security mechanisms have been defined.

Encryption mechanism 0 is based on AES-GCM-128. It is the only
mechanism currently supported by jDLMS. It uses the global unicast
encryption key and, if available, the authentication key.

Optionally a client may send a so called dedicated key (i.e. a session
key) to the server during connection build up. The dedicated key is
then used instead of the global encryption key for the remaining
communication of this connection. The dedicated key is a temporary key
that is usually generated ad-hoc at connection time.

==== Keys

Several different keys exist which are used by the different security
mechanisms.

Password/Secret:: Used by LLS. The client sends the password to the
server for authentication.

Authentication key:: Used by authentication mechanisms such as HLS 5
as well as optionally by encryption mechanisms such as
mechanism 0.

Global unicast encryption key:: Used by authentication mechanisms such
as HLS 5 as well as by encryption mechanisms such as mechanism 0.

Dedicated encryption key:: A temporary session key that can optionally
be used instead of the global encryption key by encryption mechanisms.

Master key:: The master key is used for wrapping global keys. When
changing the global encryption or authentication keys one has to wrap
the new key before transmitting it.



== Distribution

After extracting the distribution tar file the jDLMS library can be
found in the directory _build/libs-all_. For license information
check the _license_ directory in the distribution.

=== Dependencies

Besides the jDLMS library the folder _build/libs-all/_ contains the
following external libraries:

jASN1::

    A library for ASN.1 BER encoding/decoding, MPLv2.0,
    https://www.openmuc.org/asn1/

jRxTx::
    This library for serial communication is only needed by
    jDLMS if communication over HDLC/serial is used. jRxTx is a fork of
    RxTx and is hosted at https://github.com/openmuc/jrxtx. The library
    is licensed under the LGPL(v2.1 or later) + linking exception.

+

jRxTx consists of a Java part located in the _dependencies_ folder
of the distribution and a native part that is equivalent to that of
RxTx. Note that you have to install the native part of RxTx as
explained in our
link:https://www.openmuc.org/faq/how-do-i-get-serial-communication-to-work-with-rxtx/[FAQ].

Bouncy Castle (bcprov)::

   A library needed for security algorithms. It is only needed if
   jDLMS is used with encryption or high level authentication enabled.

The _dependencies_ folder in the distribution contains more detailed
license and copyright information about these dependencies.

== Modifying and Compiling jDLMS

We use the Gradle build automation tool. The distribution contains a
fully functional gradle build file (_build.gradle_). Thus if you
changed code and want to rebuild a library you can do it easily with
Gradle. Also if you want to import our software into Eclipse you can
easily create Eclipse project files using Gradle. Just follow the
instructions on our
link:https://www.openmuc.org/faq/gradle_getting_started/[FAQ site].

=== A-XDR Compiler

The jDLMS distribution contains a subproject named _A-XDR Compiler_. It
is an application developed to automatically compile the DLMS/COSEM
ASN.1 data structures and generate classes that can be used to
encode/decode A-XDR messages. The generated classes are part of
jDLMS. You will _not_ need this application if you simply want to use
the jDLMS library.
