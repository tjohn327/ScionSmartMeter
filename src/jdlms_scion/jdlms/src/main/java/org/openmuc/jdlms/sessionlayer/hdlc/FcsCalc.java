 * This class is used to compute a Frame Check Sequence according to IEC 62056-46 annex A.
 * 
 * Because a HDLC frame can have up to 2 Fast frame check sequence (FCS) fields, the actual FCS value can be read between each computed byte (as the
 * first FCS ,including all data already read, is automatically part of the 2nd FCS).
 * 
 * To compute the FCS value of several different messages, the method {@code reset()} has to be called at the beginning
 * of each subsequent message
